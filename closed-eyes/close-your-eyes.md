**Close your eyes and hope for the best**

You close your eyes and make 3 swift spins to lose your orientation of the room. You then realize that 3 spins was not enough, so you spin 3 more times.

Your eyes remain closed and you take 12 steps forward. As you are about to take your last step, you trip over an object and land on your stomach. You open your eyes to see what the object was, but you can't make out what it is because of how dark it is.
