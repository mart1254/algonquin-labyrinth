**You call for help**


You shout, and scream at the top of your lungs.

As you sit there crying for help, you hear footsteps from a distance.

The steps are getting closer, but now you hear metal scraping across the stone floor along with the steps. You sit there in silence, wishing you had tried the other option.

The footsteps stop... Right in front of you, but you can't see anything. Except you can feel the breathing of something inhuman, monster-like blow against your face.

You died a quick death...
