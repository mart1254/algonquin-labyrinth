## Turn Away And Leave

Feeling a sudden wave of apprehension, you decide that the risks outweigh the potential rewards. With a heavy heart, you turn away from the entrance of the labyrinth and make your way back to the familiar surroundings of the campus above. As you emerge into the sunlight, you can't help but feel a sense of relief wash over you. Perhaps some mysteries are best left unsolved.

Just as you're about to turn away and leave, a glint of light catches your eye from one of the darkened hallways. Curiosity piqued once more, you find yourself drawn towards it.
