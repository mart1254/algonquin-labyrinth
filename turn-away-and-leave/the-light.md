**Investigate the light**

As you cautiously approach the source of the glinting light, you discover a small, ornate chest tucked away in a shadowed alcove. The chest is locked, but a keyhole glistens invitingly in the torchlight.

With a sense of trepidation, you recall the rusty key you obtained earlier from the skeleton. Carefully, you retrieve it from your pocket and insert it into the lock. With a satisfying click, the chest opens, revealing its contentsâ€”a collection of ancient artifacts, each more intriguing than the last.

Among the artifacts, you find a beautifully crafted pendant adorned with a glowing gemstone, an old parchment containing a cryptic riddle, and a small vial filled with a mysterious, shimmering liquid. Each item seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy, filling you with a mix of wonder and caution.

As you reach out to examine the artifacts, the gemstone on the pendant suddenly flares with blinding light. Before you can react, a powerful force pulls you into the chest, consuming you in an instant.

The sunlight from the entrance glints off the gemstone, casting a haunting glow across the walls. Your presence is now a part of the labyrinth's dark history, a cautionary tale for those who dare to seek its secrets.
