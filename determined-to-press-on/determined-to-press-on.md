## Haunting

Your breath catches as the whisper grows into a chorus, a cacophony of voices that seem to echo from every direction. “The price must be paid,” they chant in unison, their tone growing more insistent, more demanding. The air grows colder, the darkness seems to press against you with tangible force.

You feel it then, a sudden gust of wind, as if the very air is being sucked towards a point behind you. You spin around, and for a split second, you see it—a wraithlike figure, a distortion in the air, a shimmering specter with eyes that burn like embers in the gloom.

It moves towards you, not walking, but gliding, leaving no trace but the rising terror in your heart. You want to run, but your legs refuse to obey, as if the labyrinth itself commands you to stay.

The specter reaches out, its hand passing through the air mere inches from your face. You feel a searing pain, as if your very memories are being extracted, a payment for the knowledge you seek. The voices crescendo, “The labyrinth claims its due!”

With a final effort, you break free from the paralysis, stumbling backwards. The specter fades into the shadows, and the voices fall silent. You’re left alone, panting, the taste of ancient dust on your tongue.

But the respite is short-lived. The labyrinth’s embrace tightens once more, and you find yourself wandering endlessly, each turn leading you deeper into its heart. The whispers of the guardians have ceased, leaving you in a silence that is both a companion and a tormentor. The darkness is no longer just around you; it has seeped inside, filling the void where hope once resided.

Days blend into nights, indistinguishable in the perpetual twilight of the labyrinth. The outside world becomes a distant memory, a fleeting thought that slips through your fingers like the dust motes dancing in the rare shafts of light.

You become a ghost in the corridors, a specter in a tomb of knowledge that will never be yours. The secrets of the labyrinth are close, so tantalizingly close, yet as unreachable as the stars in the sky you can no longer see. The labyrinth has claimed you, not just your memories, but your very being. You are its final secret, a story that will never be told, a warning that will never be heard.
