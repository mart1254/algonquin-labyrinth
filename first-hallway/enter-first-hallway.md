**Enter first hallway**

You choose the first hallway on your left and venture forth into the unknown. The corridor narrows slightly, and the air becomes cooler as you proceed. The flickering torches cast eerie shadows on the walls, creating an atmosphere of both mystery and danger.

As you walk, you notice that the paintings and pictures on the walls depict scenes from Algonquin College's pastâ€”students studying in ancient libraries, professors giving lectures in grand halls, and events long forgotten by time. The images seem to come alive in the flickering torchlight, their subjects watching you with curious eyes.

The floor beneath your feet is uneven, and you must tread carefully to avoid tripping on loose stones and patches of moss. Ahead, the corridor takes a sharp turn to the right, disappearing from view. A faint sound echoes from around the corner, like the distant rustling of leaves or the scurrying of small creatures.

As you stand at the threshold of the turn, you feel a sense of anticipation and apprehension. What lies around the corner? Will you continue on, or turn back and explore another path?
