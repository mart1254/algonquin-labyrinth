**Flee the skeleton**

Panic sets in, and you decide that fleeing back the way you came is your best option. You turn to rush back along the corridor, hoping to outpace the skeleton. However, as you run, the skeleton proves swifter than its decrepit form suggests. It quickly catches up to you, its key now wielded like a dagger. In a desperate moment, you feel a sharp jab in your back, and your vision begins to blur. The labyrinth claims another soul, as you collapse to the ground, the echo of your own footsteps the last sound you hear.

**You have died...**
