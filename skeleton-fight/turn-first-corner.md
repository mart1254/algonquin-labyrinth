**Turn Corner**

With your heart pounding in your chest, you decide to brave the unknown and proceed around the corner. As you turn, you're suddenly confronted by a skeleton clad in tattered remnants of what might have once been the uniform of a college custodian. Its hollow eyes seem to pierce through the darkness as it raises a rusty old key as if it were a weapon.

The skeleton advances with a jerky, unnerving motion, its bones clattering in the eerie silence of the labyrinth. You realize you must act quickly to defend yourself. Looking around, you spot a heavy branch that must have fallen from an old wooden support nearby. Itâ€™s not much, but it might just even the odds.

**Choose your action:**
