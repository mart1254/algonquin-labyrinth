## The Right Path

You opt to follow the right path, drawn by a faint glimmer of light flickering in the distance. With each step, the whispering sound grows more intense, sending shivers down your spine. The corridor twists and turns, leading you deeper into the labyrinthine hall.

Finally, you emerge into a vast chamber bathed in an otherworldly glow. In the center of the room stands a pedestal, upon which rests a shimmering crystal orb. Its surface swirls with mesmerizing patterns, drawing you closer with an irresistible pull.

But as you approach, a voice echoes through the chamberâ€”a haunting whisper that sends a chill down your spine. "Welcome, seeker," it murmurs.
