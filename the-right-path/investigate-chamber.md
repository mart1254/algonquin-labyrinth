**Investigate the hall further**

As you take a moment to observe your surroundings more closely, you notice intricate carvings etched into the towering pillars that line the hall. The carvings depict scenes of ancient rituals, mythical creatures, and what appear to be maps of the stars. Each pillar tells a story of a bygone era, its details weathered by time yet still retaining an air of mystique.

The floor beneath your feet is worn smooth by centuries of use, with faint markings suggesting that it once served as a meeting place or perhaps even a place of worship. Small alcoves along the walls house long-forgotten relics, their surfaces covered in a fine layer of dust and cobwebs.

As you gaze up at the ceiling, you notice a series of intricate patterns that seem to shift and change in the flickering torchlight. The patterns dance and swirl, creating an illusion of movement that is both mesmerizing and unsettling.

The air in the hall is thick with the scent of ancient stone and decay, a reminder of the passage of time and the fleeting nature of all things. Despite the eeriness of your surroundings, you can't help but feel a sense of awe at the history and mystery that surrounds you.
