**The hall**

After several minutes of walking, you approach a heavy wooden door that looks ancient and formidable. Its surface is adorned with carvings that depict various mythical creatures entwined around what appears to be a sun motif. You notice a keyhole that matches the rusty key you obtained from the skeleton.

With a deep breath, you slide the key into the lock, hearing the tumblers click as they give way. The door creaks loudly as it swings open, revealing a vast hall beyond. Inside, the hall is lined with towering pillars, each carved with intricate runes and symbols that seem to shimmer faintly in the torchlight.

As you step into the hall, a sense of unease fills the airâ€”a whispering sound that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. The floor is littered with fragments of Algonquin paraphernalia, books, uniforms, water bottles, all suggesting that many have traveled (and perhaps fallen) here before you.

Suddenly, the flickering torches flare as if reacting to your presence, casting long, dancing shadows against the walls. Up ahead, you see three pathways, each leading in a different direction:

[The left path](Darby story)\
[The center path](Jon story)\
[The right path](David story)
