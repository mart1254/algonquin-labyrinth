**The lone path**

After what feels like an eternity navigating the labyrinth's twisting corridors and facing its many challenges, you come across a narrow, unassuming passage that diverges from the main path. The walls here are less ornate, the air fresher, and a distant light seems to beckon from the end. Though wary from your experiences, hope surges within you at the possibility of escape.

As you proceed, the dim interior gradually brightens, and the oppressive weight of the underground seems to lift. The path widens, and the rough stone underfoot smooths out into a well-trodden dirt trail. A cool breeze wafts towards you, carrying the unmistakable scent of fresh air and pine—the outside world is near.

Emerging from the labyrinth, you find yourself at the edge of a small, sunlit clearing. The forest around Algonquin College stretches out before you, peaceful and inviting. Behind you, the entrance to the labyrinth looms like a dark maw, its secrets now a part of your past.

As you step into the daylight, the labyrinth’s gloom dissipates, replaced by the warmth of the sun and the chirping of birds. The sense of achievement fills you as you realize that you've not only survived but have grown from the ordeal. You’ve faced unimaginable challenges and emerged victorious, forever changed by the depths of the labyrinth.

The adventure ends here, but the story of what you’ve discovered and the mysteries you’ve unraveled will continue to echo in your mind, a constant reminder of your journey and the lessons learned in the dark.

**The end!**
