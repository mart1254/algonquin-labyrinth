## Ask Who's There

Your voice trembles slightly as you call out, "Who's there?" The words barely escape your lips before they're swallowed by the oppressive darkness. No reply comes, but the silence itself seems to answer, heavy with anticipation.

You wait, heart pounding in the stillness, when suddenly a soft whisper brushes against your ear, as if carried by the very shadows that surround you. "Knowledge is not free," it hisses, the voice neither malevolent nor kind, but undeniably ancient.

A chill runs down your spine as you realize you are not alone. The labyrinth is alive with unseen watchers, their presence felt but not seen. You remember the tales of spectral guardians, entities bound to the labyrinth, protecting its secrets with a vigilance that has spanned eons.

For a moment, you see a fleeting glimpse of movement in the periphery of your vision. You turn, but there is nothing there, only the endless corridors stretching into darkness.
