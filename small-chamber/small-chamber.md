**Proceed further into the labyrinth**

You proceed further into the labyrinth, soon discovering the corridor opens up into a small chamber, illuminated by a single, flickering torch mounted on the far wall. The light casts a warm glow over a curious sceneâ€”a small, circular table sits in the center of the room, surrounded by three chairs. On the table, you find an assortment of items that seem oddly out of place: an old, dusty book, a brass compass, and a small wooden box with intricate carvings.

As you step closer to examine the items, you hear a soft whispering sound, as if the walls themselves are speaking. The door from which you came from quickly closes, while a door in front of you opens. The rumbling of the ceiling above you adds a sense of urgency to your exploration, with no way to turn back.
